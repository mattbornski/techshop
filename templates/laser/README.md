## InkScape Templates

### What is InkScape?

[InkScape](http://www.inkscape.org/) is a free vector graphics editor.  It can be used to create vector graphics files which can then be used with a variety of tools, including the Epilog Helix laser cutter and etcher.

### How to use with the Epilog Helix laser at TechShop

Install InkScape on your own computer, and open the desired template.
Make your changes to the SVG file, bearing in mind the following things:
 - At TechShop you are required to import into the CorelDraw tool to actually send jobs to the laser; therefore, anything which is proprietary to InkScape (e.g. InkScape custom SVG extensions) will not import into CorelDraw and will be lost.
 - The laser will attempt to cut any vector of width 0.001" or smaller; anything larger will be rasterized and etched, not cut.  Thus you should make your "hairline" cut vectors of width 0.001".
