## Cribbage board

### Rationale

Let's play with the laser.

I need a project that's straightforward to design and execute, but would also drive home some of the lessons that the two-hour [Laser Cutting and Etching SBU](http://www.techshop.ws/take_classes.html?storeId=5&categoryId=10) taught but which will quickly fade if I don't actually use them.

Hopefully, this project would also be a nice useful thing if I don't screw it up, too.

Hmm, a cribbage board sounds like it would fit the bill nicely.
